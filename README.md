# Flickr Browser
Browse Flickr images with search terms

# Abstract
This Android Studio project implements an app that uses the Flickr image search API
and shows the results in a 3-column scrollable view.

# Features

To start a new search, tap the red button in the right bottom corner

The found images are organized in the three column grid

The title of the image is displayed too, if it's available

When the scrolling is near the bottom of results, a new page query is executed in background

The status bar in the bottom shows the position of the currently viewed items and total item count

Images are cached internally to avoid duplicated network operations/downloads

The app handles gracefully orientation changes
